# Bio-TikZ Studio 🔬
**An Open-Source Suite for High-Resolution Scientific Visualization and LaTeX Workflow Optimization.**

## Overview
Bio-TikZ Studio is a specialized tool designed for researchers in Molecular Biology and Computational Sciences. It bridges the gap between vector-based LaTeX (TikZ) graphics and publication-ready imagery, ensuring that complex biological diagrams maintain high fidelity (300-600 DPI) for journal submissions.

## Key Features
- **High-Res Conversion:** Transform PDF vector graphics into high-resolution PNGs with customizable DPI scaling.
- **Intelligent Auto-Crop:** Utilizes Computer Vision (PIL-based bounding box detection) to remove excessive white margins, making figures ready for presentations and posters.
- **TikZ Code Generator:** A rapid prototyping interface for generating LaTeX/TikZ code for biological nodes (Cells, Receptors, etc.), optimized for Overleaf.
- **Privacy-First:** Designed to be run locally or on private servers to ensure unpublished research data remains secure.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **PDF Engine:** PyMuPDF (fitz)
- **Image Processing:** Pillow (PIL)

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YASH4-HD/Bio-TikZ-Studio-yash.git
